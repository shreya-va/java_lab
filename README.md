1)ImageLab
Goal is to understand how images are edited. Uses EzImage.java. Started driver program is PhotoLabTester.java
PhotoLab.java-
public EzImage onlyRed(EzImage image)	This method creates a new image containing only the red aspects of the original image. You can do this by setting all the values of the green and blue pixels to 0.

public EzImage negate(EzImage image)	This method creates a new image that is a conversion of the original image to "negative" form. You don't need to make it look like a true photo negative, but you should modify all the colors in a way that turns blacks into whites, whites into blacks, dark colors into light, light into dark, etc.

public EzImage inOrder(EzImage image)	Now we're getting into some of the weird things you can do. This method takes a black and white version of the image and reorders the pixels so they are in increasing order using a single array and either the selection or insertion sort algorithm. Then the pixels will be reassembled into an image again. What does the output look like and why? (Sorting.java)


2)Sales Lab
Understand usage of Arrays , Scanner.
